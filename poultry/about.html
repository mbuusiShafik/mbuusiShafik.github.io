                Kuroilers, a dual-purpose breed producing meat and eggs, can live on a diet of kitchen and agricultural
                waste, and produce around 150 eggs per year whereas native Indian hens lay only 40 per year. The meat
                yield per bird of Kuroilers is also greater; males weigh approximately 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) and females 
                about 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) whereas the native male bird weighs 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) and females 1.2 kg (2.6 lb).
                Due to its unique genetic features, the Kuroiler is resistant to diseases. The kuroiler chick is a 
                potential bio-converter of no cost agricultural, household and natural waste abundant in villages â€” into
                human protein food and substantial incomes for rural households.
                <br>
                Kuroilers have become popular in rural areas of India, including Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, 
                Mizoram, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Meghalaya and Uttarakhand. Large numbers of landless or smallholder farmers
                primary women breed these chickens as a full-time or part-time business. Kuroilers have also been
                exported to countries such as Uganda with success.

                Layer poultry farming means raising egg laying poultry birds for the purpose of commercial egg production.
                Layer chickens are such a special species of hens, which need to be raised from when they are one day old. 
                <br>
                They start laying eggs commercially from 18-19 weeks of age. They remain laying eggs continuously till 
                their 72-78 weeks of age. They can produce about one kg of eggs by consuming about 2.25 kg of food during
                their egg laying period. For the purpose of producing hybrid eggs layer, consider the various 
                characteristics  of cock and hen before breeding. There are various types of highly egg productive layer 
                breeds available throughout the world.

                <strong>Keeping Chicks for Layer Poultry Farming:</strong>
                During the first weeks after birth, many chicks do not want to drink water due to transporting them 
                from one place to another. So you have to make adequate water drinking systems in their brooder house, 
                and you have to train them for drinking water. Mix 5% glucose with water, so that they can easily get energy.

                <strong>Vaccination and its Importance for Layer Poultry Farming:</strong>
                Vaccination program is a must for chicks for keeping them free from all types of diseases. The main advantage 
                of poultry vaccination are listed below.
                <ul>
                    <li>Timely vaccination makes disease resistance power in the body of chick.</li>
                    <li>Help to keep the hen free from infective poultry diseases.</li>
                    <li>Disease prevalence will be less.</li>
                    <li>Mortality rate will reduce.</li>
                    <li>And low mortality rate = more production = more profit </li>  
                </ul>

                Egg production from a Layer Poultry Farming depends on the care and farm management. If you take good
                 care of your birds and manage them properly, then the production and profit will be high.
                 <br>
                 <ul>
                    <em>Withing the first 20 weeks of age, about 5% of hens start laying eggs:</em>
                    <li>About 10% birds start laying at their 21 weeks of age.</li>
                    <li>When they reach 26 to 30 weeks of age, they produce highly. Although, it may be different 
                        depending on their strain.
                    </li>
                    <li>After laying a maximum number of eggs, they usually stop laying for a few days.</li>
                    <li>And after this period, their egg production might reduces slowly.</li>
                    <li>Egg laying rate and size of eggs increases gradually.</li>
                    <li>The hens grow till their 40 weeks of age.</li>
                    <li>Weight and size of eggs increases till their 50 weeks of age. </li>
